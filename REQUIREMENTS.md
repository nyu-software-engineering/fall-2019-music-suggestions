Background: 
I’m a high school student from California and I love listening to current music artists because I like to gossiping to my friends about it. I adore Taylor Swift and I think she’s amazing she’s idol. I watch a bunch of different things on youtube but I want music artists that I care about directly on my page. Sometimes I don’t see the next Justin Bieber’s new MV directly because I haven’t yet subscribed or discovered it on YT.

Background:
I’m a videographer constantly trying to understand how to shoot videos that match music. I am also looking to see how professionals shoot and edit their videos. I often try to discover new music to expand my skills and my creativity. When I’m not working on my own videos, I enjoy watching well-made music videos and seeing how they create these videos.

I’m a student in India coming to LA for a college exchange program and I want to learn more about american culture to fit in with my future peers and chill out with my US homies. I know a lot of music from my own culture, but we don’t always listen to American music and I’m not familiar with any artist and I would like to learn.

I am a mother of 3, and I often like listening to my generation’s music and I like reminiscing my youth. I need something simple and easy to use without the complexity of too many features. I am also pretty busy taking care of my kids so I don’t have the most time to peruse the web looking around for verified music. I also want to have background music playing when I’m doing chores and taking care of the kids.
