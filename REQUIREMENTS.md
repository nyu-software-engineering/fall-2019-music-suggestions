Michelle Pham
Age: 32
Phone: 929-213-9989
Background: I’m an investment banker for the last 8 years making a ton of money but don’t have a whole lot of time to explore the art scene in NYC. I’m getting married this winter and I want to find a photographer and band but I also want to make sure they will meet my standard. I’ll probably feel more comfortable if the person I will hire has a good rating from previous gigs and they can also show me what they’ve done before so I can have a realistic expectation of what they can do. I want them to be locally in NYC so I don’t have to pay too much for travel

Troy Brooke
Age: 25
Phone: 781-228-2187
Background: I have been a photographer for many years, having studied photography in both college and post grad. I am a freelance photographer so I often shoot big events and portraits for my clients. However, it is hard for me to find work, as the only way I have been marketing my portfolio is through my social media, which limits my clients to mostly being within my social circle. I would like to expand my business to more people and have opportunities that I would not normally get.

Nancy Rubinovitz
Age: 28
Phone 917-540-2641
Background: I’m an events manager stationed in downtown Brooklyn for our companies Christmas party we would like a talent and energetic DJ and musicians to entertain our employees. We would like to meet these artists in person before we hire them so it's probably best for them to be local artists. We sometimes have sudden events and also need to find entertainers on a short notice so trying to find artists is difficult for us.
 
Name: Sara Pembroke
Age: 23
Phone: 949-213-9989
Background:
I am an employee of a DIY music venue in Brooklyn. I am in charge of booking local acts for our weekly events. I often have trouble connecting with local bands to fill our slots, and the bands I do find are rarely available or in the correct music genre. Our venue likes to promote local artists, but it is often extremely time consuming to find them and book them at a short notice. It would be great if I could screen a band’s music and availability before I take the time to reach out to them about playing one of our shows.  


Jack McCarthy
Age: 27
Phone: 555-398-2216
I am the lead singer of the post punk band “The Slugs” based in Queens. We often play the same local venues every month because it’s hard to promote ourselves to other venues. I don’t know who to contact or how to get their attention. We try to promote ourselves on other social media platforms, but with so many other types of profiles on these sites, it would be a miracle if a booking manager actually found us.
