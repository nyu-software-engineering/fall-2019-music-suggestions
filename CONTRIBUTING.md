## Instructions to Download and Run

To Download, clone the respository. In your terminal window, navigate to the 'backend' folder by following the path:

fall-2019-music-suggestions/Haven/haven-app/backend

Run the backend with the command 'nodemon server' to connect to MongoDB.

Go back into the 'haven-app' directory and run the command 'npm start' to run the frontend. A bowser window should automatically load.

To sign into an example user, use the credential 'mgrossenbacher' for both the username and password feilds. 

If there are any issues, check to make sure all of the necessary dependancies are installed for the frontend and backend. Further follow up on any issues can be sent to mrg498@nyu.edu.

## Definition of Done

An issue is considered complete when it has been reviewed and approved by the Product Owner. 

## Git Workflow

We are utilizing a feature-branch workflow.

## Conflict Resolution

Work related conflict between developers will be handled by the development team. If a resolution can not be unanimously agreed upon, the issue will be brought to the Professor. More serious conflict as outlined in our code of conduct should be swiftly brought to the attention of the professor.  

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at mrg498@nyu.edu. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
